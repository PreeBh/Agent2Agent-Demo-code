# 🧠 A2A Agent Samples – Powered by Google's Agent-to-Agent Protocol

Welcome to the `a2a_samples` repository! This project contains multiple implementations of AI agents using [Google's A2A (Agent-to-Agent)](https://github.com/google/A2A) protocol.

These implementations demonstrate how to:

* Set up and run A2A-compliant servers and clients
* Use discovery endpoints and standardized task formats
* Integrate with Google's ADK (Agent Development Kit)

We plan to continuously add more versions to illustrate various approaches and frameworks.
